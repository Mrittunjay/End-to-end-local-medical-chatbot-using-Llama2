       "Document(page_content='The symptoms of CO poisoning in order of increas-\\ning severity include:\\n• headache\\n• shortness of breath\\n• dizziness\\n• fatigue• mental confusion and difficulty thinking\\n• loss of fine hand-eye coordination\\n• nausea and vomiting• rapid heart rate\\n• hallucinations\\n• inability to execute voluntary movements accurately• collapse\\n• lowered body temperature ( hypothermia )\\n• coma• convulsions• seriously low blood pressure\\n• cardiac and respiratory failure\\n• death\\nIn some cases, the skin, mucous membranes, and\\nnails of a person with CO poisoning are cherry red orbright pink. Because the color change doesn’t alwaysoccur, it is an unreliable symptom to rely on for diagnosis.\\nAlthough most CO poisoning is acute, or sudden, it is\\npossible to suffer from chronic CO poisoning. This condi-tion exists when a person is exposed to low levels of the gasover a period of days to months. Symptoms are often vagueand include (in order of frequency) fatigue, headache,dizziness, sleep disturbances, cardiac symptoms, apathy,nausea, and memory disturbances. Little is known aboutchronic CO poisoning, and it is often misdiagnosed.KEY TERMS\\nCarboxyhemoglobin (COHb) —Hemoglobin that\\nis bound to carbon monoxide instead of oxygen.\\nHemoglobin (Hb) —A molecule that normally\\nbinds to oxygen in order to carry it to our cells,where it is required for life.\\nHypothermia —Development of a subnormal body\\ntemperature.\\npH—A measurement of the acidity or alkalinity of\\na fluid. A neutral fluid, neither acid nor alkali, hasa pH of 7.Diagnosis\\nThe main reason to suspect CO poisoning is evidence\\nthat fuel is being burned in a confined area, for example acar running inside a closed garage, a charcoal grill burn-ing indoors, or an unvented kerosene heater in a work-shop. Under these circumstances, one or more personssuffering from the symptoms listed above strongly sug-gests CO poisoning. In the absence of some concrete rea-son to suspect CO poisoning, the disorder is often misdi-agnosed as migraine headache ,stroke , psychiatric ill-\\nness, food poisoning , alcohol poisoning, or heart disease.\\nConcrete confirmation of CO poisoning comes from\\na carboxyhemoglobin test. This blood test measures theamount of CO that is bound to hemoglobin in the body.Blood is drawn as soon after suspected exposure to COas possible.\\nOther tests that are useful in determining the extent\\nof CO poisoning include measurement of other arterialblood gases and pH; a complete blood count ; measure-\\nment of other blood components such as sodium, potassi-um, bicarbonate, urea nitrogen, and lactic acid; an elec-trocardiogram (ECG); and a chest x ray .\\nTreatment\\nImmediate treatment for CO poisoning is to remove\\nthe victim from the source of carbon monoxide gas andget him or her into fresh air. If the victim is not breathingand has no pulse, cardiopulmonary resuscitation\\n(CPR ) should be started. Depending on the severity of\\nthe poisoning, 100% oxygen may be given with a tightfitting mask as soon as it is available.\\nTaken with other symptoms of CO poisoning, COHb\\nlevels of over 25% in healthy individuals, over 15% inpatients with a history of heart or lung disease, and over10% in pregnant women usually indicate the need forhospitalization. In the hospital, fluids and electrolytes aregiven to correct any imbalances that have arisen from thebreakdown of cellular metabolism.\\nIn severe cases of CO poisoning, patients are given\\nhyperbaric oxygen therapy. This treatment involves plac-ing the patient in a chamber breathing 100% oxygen at apressure of more than one atmosphere (the normal pres-sure the atmosphere exerts at sea level). The increasedpressure forces more oxygen into the blood. Hyperbaricfacilities are specialized, and are usually available only atlarger hospitals.\\nPrognosis\\nThe speed and degree of recovery from CO poison-\\ning depends on the length and duration of exposure to\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 652Carbon monoxide poisoningGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 652', metadata={'source': 'data\\\\medical-book.pdf', 'page': 40})"
